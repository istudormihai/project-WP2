## Description
OpenBid is an online auction platform where users can list items for sale and place bids in real time. The platform will support different user roles, including bidders(clients) and admins.

1. As a bidder, I want to place bids on items so that I can compete to win an auction.

   - A logged-in user can browse active auctions.
   - The system prevents bidding below the current highest bid.

2. As a seller, I want to list an item for auction so that I can sell it to the highest bidder.

   - A user can upload an image, set a starting price, and specify an auction duration.
   - The auction starts immediately after approval by an admin.

3. As an admin, I want to manage auction listings so that I can ensure fair auctioning and prevent fraudulent activity.

   - Admins can approve or reject auction listings.
   - Suspicious bids or users can be removed.
   - Admins can monitor ongoing auctions and bid history.
